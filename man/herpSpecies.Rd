\title{Reptile species summary}
\usage{
herpSpecies(url, higherTaxa = TRUE, fullHigher = FALSE, getlink = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A character string with the url from an advanced search in Reptile Database website or from letsHerp::herpAdvancedSearch.}

\item{higherTaxa}{A logical value indicating if user wants higher taxa information (specifically: Order, Suborder, Family and Genus) for each species. default = \emph{TRUE}}

\item{fullHigher}{A logical value indicating if user wants the full higher taxa information (including e.g.: subfamily) for each species, as available in The Reptile Database website (e.g. single character string). default = \emph{FALSE}. OBS.: Requires higherTaxa = TRUE}

\item{getlink}{A logical value indicating if user wants the url that provides access to each species information (e.g: to use with herpSynonyms()). default = \emph{TRUE}}
}
\value{
if \emph{higherTaxa} = FALSE (default), the function returns a vector with the list of species

if \emph{higherTaxa} = TRUE, the function returns a data frame with columns: order, family, genus and species

Optionally, the function might return a data frame with a column with the full higher taxa information as reported in The Reptile Database, and the species respective url
}
\description{
Creates a data frame containing higher taxa information for a list of reptile species based on a Reptile Database advanced search optionally with their respective url.
